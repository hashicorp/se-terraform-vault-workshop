Terraform Enterprise
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 60%](images/TFE_GUI.png)]

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

???
**Until now we've been using only open source features. Sooner or later you'll reach a point where you want more tools for governance and collaboration. Terraform open source is great for small environments and developers, but when you need multiple people or teams to collaborate on the same infrastructure, Terraform Enterprise features can help.**

Terraform Enterprise
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 60%](images/TFE_GUI.png)]

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

* Easy Mode - UI integration with Version Control System

???
**As your organization begins to standardize on Terraform, you'll have different types of users. Most of you will become terraform experts, but there may be others who just want to build things. They can use the terraform code that folks like you have written. To make this process easy, we have a web application. You log on, click a button, and out pops your infrastructure.**

Terraform Enterprise
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 60%](images/TFE_GUI.png)]

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

* Easy Mode - UI integration with Version Control System
* Advanced Users - API driven workflow with CI/CD pipeline

???
**For our more advanced users we have a fully featured RESTful API. This is useful for programmatic access to terraform features. You can drive terraform plan and apply commands using an API interface. If you have a CI/CD pipeline you can automate your terraform builds as part of your process.**

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

* Easy Mode - UI integration with Version Control System
* Advanced Users - API driven workflow with CI/CD pipeline
* Centralized Terraform state management

???
**Terraform enterprise also provides safe and secure storage for your state files. Instead of having that important state file stored on someone's laptop, now it is safely stored in the Terraform Enterprise application. Only those who need access to the state file can see it, and it is protected from being overwritten or corrupted.**

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

* Easy Mode - UI integration with Version Control System
* Advanced Users - API driven workflow with CI/CD pipeline
* Centralized Terraform state management
* Private Module Registry for sharing code

???
**Eventually you'll have a library of Terraform code that you might like to share and publish for other users and teams in your company. The private module registry makes this easy. You build reusable modules that build infrastructure according to standards, and then publish them for your users. This can help with enforcing security policies and build standards.**

Terraform Enterprise is a cloud-based or on-premise application that provides the following features:

* Easy Mode - UI integration with Version Control System
* Advanced Users - API driven workflow with CI/CD pipeline
* Centralized Terraform state management
* Private Module Registry for sharing code
* Sentinel policy enforcement

???
**TFE also comes with a policy enforcement engine that can ensure that your users don't build things they shouldn't build, or configure them in the wrong way. For example, you might wish to prevent users from opening network ports to the internet, or from building too many virtual machines. All of these types of rules can be expressed using our Sentinel policy enforcement engine. Sentinel policies prevent users from doing bad things, *before* they provision to the cloud.**

Chapter 2  
Review the Basics
]

name: tfe-workstation-setup-0
Terraform Workstation Requirements
-------------------------
<br><br>In order to proceed you'll need a Terraform workstation and valid Azure account credentials. You will also need a free [github.com](https://github.com) account, and have both git and terraform installed on your workstation.

**Option 1:** Use a cloud-based workstation. Your instructor will provide you with the address and RDP credentials.

**Option 2:** Bring your own Azure account and use Azure Cloudshell.

**Option 3:** [Generate a Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/terraform-install-configure#configure-terraform-environment-variables) - for advanced users.

???
**Today we'll be using cloud-based workstations that have all the software you need pre-installed. There are no firewalls, no ticketing systems and no blockers in the lab environment. It is your own personal Terraform playground. All the skills you learn here today can be applied to your own Terraform Enterprise server as well. All the exercises will be done in our Azure training account. Please be kind to our training account, no bittorrent or crypto mining please.**

The expectation here is that everybody starts the workshop with a workstation that can run `terraform apply` and build things in an Azure account. You should always default to Option 1.  If advanced students want to try options #2 and #3 tell them they are on their own for troubleshooting.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-1
Log Onto Your Workstation
-------------------------

Your instructor will provide you with a workstation URL that looks like this:

.center[.h1[myworkstation01.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com]]

.center[![:scale 50%](images/rdp_login.png)]

Use Remote Desktop (RDP) to access your workstation. Your instructor will provide the username and password.

???
Note to the instructor - outbound access on TCP port 3389 is required for this to work. Always have someone at the client check that they can access a test workstation *before* you go on site. You don't want to show up for training and find out that RDP access is blocked from the network you're using.

RDP is installed by default on almost all Windows corporate PCs and laptops. If your students are on Mac they can download the official Microsoft RDP client from the app store.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-2
Run the setup_azure.ps1 script
-------------------------
<br><br>
.center[![:scale 70%](images/run_setup.png)]

Right click on the file called 'setup' on your desktop and select 'Run with Powershell'. Type Y for Yes when it asks about changing your execution policy.

**WARNING:** Do not skip this step. It is required to set up your connection to Azure Cloud.

???
**This handy script does some setup and fetches dynamic Azure credentials from our training Vault server. Right click on the setup_azure.ps1 file and select the "Run with Powershell" option. It may take a minute or two to finish.**

If anyone is curious what this powershell script does, it's disabling windows line endings for git clone. It also fetches dynamic Azure credentials that are good for 8 hours.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-3
Run the setup_azure.ps1 script
-------------------------
Answer Yes or Yes to All to the question about Execution Policy.
```tex
Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"):
```

.center[![:scale 100%](images/ready_to_terraform.png)]

You should see this banner if the script ran successfully. 

???
**Close the powershell window where you ran the setup script.**

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-4
Open Visual Studio Code
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/set_colors_and_icons.png)]

A web browser window will pop open with the latest Visual Studio Code release notes. You may close the web browser. Click the little gear icon in the lower left corner. Adjust your font size and color scheme to something comfortable.

???
**Let's take a moment to move in and get comfortable. You can click on this little gear icon in the lower left corner to access your settings. Pick a color theme and font size that are easy on the eyes. You can also adjust your icons. I like the vscode-icons set, which has an icon for almost every type of file you can imagine.**

I like to demo this part for the students. My personal favorites are Dracula and vscode-icons. Remember that some of these folks have never used Visual Studio Code before. Know where the font, color, and icon settings are and show them how to change these.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-6
Install the Terraform Extension
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/install_terraform_extension.png)]

Click the box shaped icon on the left side menu. This brings you to the Extensions Marketplace. Search for Terraform. Install the first one on the list. Click the 'Reload' button once it is done installing.

???
**The terraform extension gives you syntax highlighting, code completion, and the ability to run terraform commands right from the command palette.**

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-7
Open the Integrated Terminal
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 70%](images/open_terminal.png)]

Open the integrated VSC terminal using the menu or keyboard shortcut. Powershell is set as your default shell.

You can change this anytime using the pulldown menu on the Terminal where it says **powershell**.

???
We've seen this popup sometimes take two tries to save properly. It might be a bug. In any case it shouldn't matter because the default is Powershell which is what we want. You can also try git bash although it hasn't been tested with *all* the exercises in the lab. YMMV.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-8
Fork the Application Repo
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/fork.png)]
Log onto your github account and navigate to this URL:

.center[https://github.com/scarolan/hashicat]

Click on the **Fork** button in the upper right corner. This will create an exact copy of the repo in your own account. Keep the new repo open in your web browser.

???
**You'll need your own copy of this repo for some of the labs we'll be doing today. It can be helpful to log onto your github account from inside your workstation. This way you never have to leave the lab environment.**

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-9
Clone Your Training Repo
-------------------------
<br><br>
Run the following commands to clone the training repository from GitHub. Replace **GITUSER** with your own git username.

```powershell
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/GITUSER/hashicat
cd hashicat
```

Now reload your text editor in the current directory with the code command:

```powershell
code -r .
```

???
`code -r .` means 'reload the editor in the current directory'.

---
name: tfe-workstation-setup-10
Optional - Install posh-git
-------------------------
If you'd like a fancy git-enabled shell prompt try the posh-git extension. This is an optional step. You may answer Yes to any prompts or security warnings.

Commands:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
install-module posh-git
import-module posh-git
```

Output
```tex
Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy value by running the
Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y

C:\Users\hashicorp\Desktop\hashicat [master ≡]>
```

???
**This extension helps you see at a glance the current status of a Git repository. This will only enable it for the current shell. If you want to make it permanent the import module command can be added to your Powershell profile. We're not going to cover that in this class.**

---
name: tfe-set-prefix
Set the Prefix Variable
-------------------------
<br><br>
Rename the **terraform.tfvars.example** file to **terraform.tfvars**.  

Change where it says "yourname" to your own name. No spaces or special characters please. **Keep it all lowercase.** Save the file.

```tex
# Rename or copy this file to terraform.tfvars
# Prefix must be all lowercase letters, no symbols please.

*prefix = "yourname"
```

The **terraform.tfvars** file is your own personal settings file. You can use it to set or override any of the default variables in the variables.tf file.

**Everyone must choose a unique prefix. 5-12 characters. All lowercase and/or numbers.**

???
**Let's go ahead and set this variable in a file so we don't have to type it in every time we run terraform commands. You're going to simply rename the terraform.tfvars.example file to terraform.tfvars. Terraform knows to look for files that end in .tf or .tfvars. You can right click the file right inside VSC to rename it. You may put any text you like here but be sure and avoid very common names and words, or add a number to the end to guarantee it is unique.**

NOTE TO INSTRUCTOR: If students have a very common name, they should add a number to the end of it to guarantee that it is available. The default Azure public 'cloudapp' DNS zone is a global namespace. If your student enters a very common word here, there's a chance it could be taken already. This will cause the Terraform run to fail.

---
name: tfe-terraform-init
Run Terraform Init
-------------------------
Run the **`terraform init`** command in your Terminal:

Command:
```powershell
terraform init
```

Output:
```tex
Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (terraform-providers/null) 2.1.2...
- Downloading plugin for provider "azurerm" (terraform-providers/azurerm) 1.32.1...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Terraform fetches any required providers and modules and stores them in the **.terraform** directory. You can take a peek inside that directory where you'll see the plugins folder.

???
**Terraform has an extendible architecture. You download the core program, terraform, then it fetches plugins and modules that are required for your code.**

---
name: dot-terraform-directory
The Dot Terraform Directory
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 90%](images/dot_terraform_directory.png)]

Look in your file browser on the left side panel. You'll see a new directory called **`.terraform`**. Terraform stores its plugins and modules here.


---
name: tfe-terraform-apply
Run Terraform Apply
-------------------------
Run **`terraform apply -auto-approve`** in your terminal:

Command:
```powershell
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Output:
```tex
azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup: Creating...
  location: "" => "centralus"
  name:     "" => "seanclab-workshop"
  tags.%:   "" => "<computed>"
azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup: Creation complete after 0s (ID: /subscriptions/14692f20-9428-451b-8298-...39c2a/resourceGroups/seanclab-workshop)
...

Outputs:
catapp_url = http://seanclab-meow.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

???
**We've built some terraform here that you probably wouldn't use in the real world.  It's been customized so that you can finish a run in 15 seconds instead of five to ten minutes. Some of what we did here is a bit unorthodox, for the sake of speed.**

**Note**: There is a [known bug](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/12596) with the null_provisioner that *may* cause your run to hang if you're using Terraform 0.11.x.

When this happens (terminal hangs for more than 30 seconds), have your student simply click on the little trash can icon in VSC, then reopen the terminal and run `terraform apply` again.  The problem should be gone, as the run did complete successfully.  

This issue appears to be fixed with Terraform 0.12

.center[.lab-header[👩🏽‍🔬 Lab Exercise 2: Re-provision the App]]
<br><br><br>
The application has three variables that you can set to change the look and feel of your site.

They are **height**, **width**, and **placeholder**. 

Redeploy your app with a different height and width and reload the page.

If you need a refresher on variables visit the docs:

https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variables-on-the-command-line

HINT: Variables can be set in a config file or as command line flags.

---
name: chapter-2-tfe-lab-solution
.center[.lab-header[👩🏽‍🔬 Lab Exercise 2: Solution]]
<br><br><br>
Here's an example where we simply override variables on the command line:

Commands:
```powershell
terraform apply -var placeholder=www.fillmurray.com -var height=500 -var width=500
```

Try some different placeholder image sites. Here are some examples: [placedog.net](http://placedog.net), [placebear.com](http://placebear.com), [www.fillmurray.com](http://www.fillmurray.com), [www.placecage.com](http://www.placecage.com), [placebeard.it](http://placebeard.it), [loremflickr.com](http://loremflickr.com), [baconmockup.com](http://baconmockup.com), and [placeimg.com](http://placeimg.com).

???
Point out that we're doing some things here that you shouldn't do in production (like using null_resource for our provisioner.) You can also review the different ways to set variables:

https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definition-precedence

It can be helpful to have your own lab workstation to demonstrate some of the solutions. You can flip back and forth between your lab workstation and the slide deck in full-screen mode.

Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise?
-------------------------
<br><br><br>
**[Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/signup)** is a hosted application that provides features like remote state management, API driven runs, policy management and more. Many users prefer a cloud based SaaS solution because they don't want to maintain the infrastructure to run it.

**[Terraform Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/go/terraform-enterprise)** is the same application, but it runs in your cloud environment or data center. Some users require more control over the Terraform Enterprise application, or wish to run it in restricted networks behind corporate firewalls.

The feature list for these two offerings is nearly identical. We will be using Terraform Cloud accounts for our lab exercises today.*

???
**All the skills you learn today on our Terraform Cloud platform will translate directly to Terraform Enterprise because the feature set is the same.**

At the instructor's discretion, this course can also be taught with an on-prem Terraform Enterprise server. We highly recommend sticking to the cloud based training though, to avoid any blockers or issues in the enterprise...

Terraform stores information about the resources it has built in a **state file**. This important file contains all of the data that terraform needs to change, update, and delete infrastructure. The local state file has some disadvantages:

* Sometimes contains secrets or sensitive data
* Can't collaborate because the file is on someone's laptop
* Risk of losing or deleting the state file
* No centralized record keeping

Let's migrate our local state file into Terraform Enterprise where it will be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.

Terraform Remote State
-------------------------
Terraform Remote State requirements:

* Terraform Enterprise (or Cloud) account
* User access token stored in your config file
* A **.terraformrc** (Unix) or **terraform.rc** (Windows) file. Example:

```hcl
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "REPLACE_ME"
}
```
* Remote backend config file named **remote_backend.tf**. Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "ORGNAME"
    workspaces {
      name = "YOURWORKSPACE"
    }
  }
}
```

.center[We'll create these two files during the lab exercise.]

???
**You need two config files to get remote state working. First is your .terraformrc (or terraform.rc on Windows), and the second is a remote_backend.tf with the terraform block of code in it. The credentials file holds your token, while the config file tells terraform where to store your state file.  We'll be creating these two files in a moment.**

---
name: chapter-4-tfe-lab
.center[.lab-header[👩🏽‍🔬 Lab Exercise 4: Enable Remote State]]
<br><br>
In this lab exercise you will enable Terraform remote state on your workstation. There are three ingredients you'll need to make it work:

* A User Access Token for your config file
* A **terraform.rc** file located at `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc`
* A **remote_backend.tf** file in the hashicat folder

Explore the Terraform Enterprise UI and find your user settings. From there, figure out how to generate a token.

Once you have a token, create your terraform.rc file. Here's an easy way to do that from your Powershell terminal:
```powershell
cd $env:APPDATA
code terraform.rc
```

Create a **remote_backend.tf** in the hashicat folder.

Use the examples on the previous slide for reference.

???
%APPDATA% is a shortcut on Windows to your application data directory. You can also go directly to `C:\Users\hashicorp\AppData\Roaming`.

We've provided a sample remote_backend.tf file that you can use to get started. It's called remote_backend.tf.disabled.

* Create a **user token**: https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens
* Edit your **`%APPDATA%\terraform.rc`** config file, replacing where it says REPLACE_ME with your token.

```powershell
code %APPDATA%/terraform.rc
```
```hcl
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "REPLACE_ME"
}
```

* Rename the **remote_backend.tf.disabled** file to **remote_backend.tf**. It should contain the following code. Replace ORGNAME and YOURWORKSPACE with your own settings.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "ORGNAME"
    workspaces {
      name = "YOURWORKSPACE"
    }
  }
}

Run a **`terraform init`** command to migrate to remote state.  You should see output similar to what's below. Answer **`yes`** to the confirmation prompt:

Command:
```powershell
cd ~/Desktop/hashicat
terraform init
```

Output:
```tex
Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "remote" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "remote" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "remote"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes

*Successfully configured the backend "remote"! Terraform will automatically
*use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Now when you run **`terraform apply`**, your state is automatically stored in your Terraform Enterprise/Cloud account.

.center[![:scale 100%](images/remote_state_free.png)]

Enterprise users gain extra features like remote execution, secure variable storage, code reviews, and collaboration tools.

Delete Your State File
-------------------------

**WARNING**: Make sure you have enabled remote state and confirmed that your state file is being stored in Terraform Enterprise.

Once you've confirmed that remote state is working, go ahead and delete the **terraform.tfstate** file from your local workspace directory.

Command:
```powershell
Remove-Item terraform.tfstate
```

You don't need to remove the backup copy of your state file.


???
**Now our state file is safely stored and encrypted in Terraform Enterprise. There's actually a small Vault instance running under the hood that handles all our encryption needs.**

Protecting Sensitive Variables

name: where-are-your-creds
Where Are Your API Keys?
-------------------------
Terraform requires credentials in order to communicate with your cloud provider's API. These API keys should never, ever be stored directly in your terraform code. Config files and environment variables are a better option, but the credentials still live on your workstation, usually stored in plaintext.

Try this command on your workstation to see your API credentials:

Command:
```powershell
gci env:ARM*
```

Output:
```tex
Name                           Value
----                           -----

**Note how our API keys are just sitting there in plain text. This isn't the most secure way to build cloud resources.**

---
name: why-storing-creds-bad
Plain Text API Keys Are Dangerous!
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 60%](images/sophos_headline.png)]

Sensitive credentials like Azure Service Principal API keys should always be protected. Storing admin-level credentials on employee laptops is a risky proposition. These credentials could accidentally be leaked or stolen. 

Instead of storing credentials locally you can encrypt them and store them safely in your Terraform Enterprise workspace. This feature is enabled when we turn on Remote Execution.

Remote execution runs in a secure container on the Terraform Enterprise server cluster. 

.tinytext[https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/03/25/thousands-of-coders-are-leaving-their-crown-jewels-exposed-on-github/]

**With Remote Execution enabled all terraform runs now happen on the TFE server inside of a secure container. Sensitive variables are provided to the container at runtime and never exposed in plain text.**

---
name: enable-remote-execution
Enable Remote Execution
-------------------------
<br><br>
.center[![:scale 100%](images/remote_execution.png)]

Before we migrate our sensitive API credentials into the application we need to enable remote execution. Under the **General** settings for your workspace, change the Execution Mode to **Remote**. Click the **Save Settings** button at the bottom of the page.

???
**When remote execution is enabled, all of your variables are stored in Terraform Enterprise, and the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands now happen on the server instead of on your workstation. State is still stored remotely as before. Your command line simply becomes a tool for driving the remote execution.**

A Better Way to Store Sensitive Data
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 100%](images/encrypted_vars.png)]

Terraform Enterprise can safely store your credentials and encrypt them for you. In the next lab we'll store your Azure credentials as sensitive TFE variables.

???
**This is our target state. When you are done all your credentials should be stored safely like this.**

---

.center[.lab-header[👩🏻‍🏫 Lab Exercise 5a: Sensitive Variables]]
<br><br>
Create Terraform Enterprise **environment variables** for your Azure credentials. Make sure the `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` is marked as **sensitive**. Here's the command to see your credentials:

Command:
```powershell
gci env:ARM*
```

Output:
```tex

**Step 1**: Run the **`install_tfh.sh`** script inside of the **hashicat/files** directory. You may simply copy and paste the commands below:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/hashicat/files
./install_tfh.sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```

**Step 2**: Configure the required environment variables. _Replace with your own organization and workspace._

```bash
export TFH_org=ORGNAME

Sentinel is HashiCorp's policy enforcement language. Sentinel policies are checked after **`terraform plan`** is run. Sentinel will intercept bad configurations *before* they go to production, not after. 

Sentinel rules help enforce compliance and security requirements in the cloud. Sentinel is a feature of Terraform Enterprise.

???
**Think of all the dos and do-nots that you want to enforce in your cloud environments. Maybe you want to limit the sizes of virtual machines, or to force web applications to always use SSL. Sentinel rules can be customized for most common security and compliance requirements.**

Talk about Sentinel and some other things you can do with it.

```hcl

  "n1-standard-2",
  "n1-standard-4",
]
```

With programmatic policy as code, custom governance can be enforced at the same rate as infrastructure is provisioned.  
* Codifying policies automates guardrails around provisioning 
* Policy checks built into the provisioning workflow
* Use policy to enforce best-practices, security measures, or compliance  


Here are some example policies:

Let's implement a simple Sentinel policy Set for our organization. This will ensure that newly created workspaces will be compliant with our security policies.

We'll tackle this in two steps:

1. Fork a repo that contains a Sentinel Policy Set
2. Add the policy set from our new repo

.center[.lab-header[👮🏿‍♀️ Lab Exercise 7: Secure the App]]
<br><br>
The security team has a new requirement: All Azure VMs must be tagged with an **environment** tag. We have implemented a policy that disallows building any VMs that do not have this tag.

Figure out how to edit your Terraform code to add a tag to your virtual machine. The name of the tag should be **environment** and the value should be **production**.

When you are done you should see all your Sentinel tests passing in the UI:

.center[![:scale 80%](images/policy_check_passed.png)]

Instructor Note: walk around and check on your students as they work through the lab.

---
name: chapter-7-tfe-lab-solution
.center[.lab-header[👮🏿‍♀️ Lab Exercise 7: Solution]]
<br><br>
Our new Sentinel policy looks through the Terraform plan output and searches for any VMs that do not have an environment tag. You can fix this by adding a tag block to your virtual machine, and then running **`terraform apply`**.

Note - this is *inside* the Virtual Machine block. It doesn't matter where you put it as long as it is nested in the azurerm_virtual_machine resource. Remember, you still need to commit your code to your VCS repo to trigger the change.

Solution:
```hcl
tags = {
  environment = "production"
}
```

Instructor Note: Review the basic git commands here if needbe:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add tag to VM."
git push origin master

**Partner 1**:
1. Go into your organization's team settings and create a new team called **developers**. 
2. Visit your workspace's **Team Access** menu and grant **write** access to your developers team.
3. Invite your partner to your organization's **developers** team.

One of your team members needs a larger virtual machine size for load testing. This is another partner exercise.

**Partner 1**:
In Partner 2's workspace, create a new variable called **vm_size** and set it to **Standard_A1_v2**. Click on the **Queue Plan** button to trigger a new terraform plan. What happens? Are you able to override the Sentinel failure and continue?

**Partner 2**:
Log onto your workspace and navigate to the current run. Have a discussion with Partner 1 about why they need a larger VM. Agree upon a solution and redeploy the application.

Exchange roles and repeat the lab exercise.

.center[.lab-header[🔒 Lab Exercise 9b: Solution]]
<br><br>
.center[![:scale 100%](images/standard_a1_v2.png)]
One of the Sentinel policies we enabled checks any Azure Virtual Machines that appear in the plan, and looks at the configured vm_size. This is compared to the list of approved types which includes only **Standard_A0** and **Standard_A1**. Anything outside of these two approved sizes of VM will be flagged by Sentinel.

There's no single correct answer to this lab. You may decide that partner 1 doesn't need such a large VM for their development work. Or partner 2 might grant an exception and use their admin powers to override the Sentinel failure. Or perhaps the new VM size could be added to the Sentinel rule to allow it as a new option.

name: reset-environment
Reset the Lab Environment
-------------------------
Before the next chapter we need to make some simple modifications to our **main.tf** and **outputs.tf** files. 

In **main.tf** delete everything below the first resource in the file:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myresourcegroup" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

# EVERYTHING BELOW HERE GETS DELETED
# resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
#   name                = "${var.prefix}-vnet"
```

Delete your entire **outputs.tf** file too. We don't need it anymore.

Save your changes, commit them to git, and push to your remote repository. This will reset your environment to an empty resource group.

TFE Private Module Registry
-------------------------
.center[![:scale 80%](images/pmr.png)]

Terraform modules are reusable packages of Terraform code that you can use to build your infrastructure. Terraform Enterprise includes a Private Module Registry where you can store, version, and distribute modules to your organizations and teams.

---
name: chapter-10a-tfe-lab
.center[.lab-header[📚 Lab Exercise 10a: Install a Module]]
<br><br><br>
This is an individual lab. 

1. Visit the Terraform public module registry and navigate to the [Web App Container Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/innovationnorway/web-app-container/azurerm).
2. Find the github source code link on the page and click on it.
3. Fork the module repo into your own github account.
4. Back in your TFE organization, navigate to the **modules** section and add the Azure Compute module to your private registry.

If you have a valid VCS connection, the private module registry can find any git repositories that you have access to. These module repos can be imported into Terraform Enterprise, where your users can easily access them.

---
name: use-a-module
Use the Compute Module
-------------------------
Add the following code to your main.tf file, right below the resource group. Be sure to replace **`YOURORGNAME`** with your own organization name.

```terraform
module "web_app_container" {
* source              = "app.terraform.io/YOURORGNAME/web-app-container/azurerm"
  name                = "${var.prefix}"
  port                = "80"
  https_only          = "false"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.myresourcegroup.name}"
  container_type      = "docker"
  container_image     = "scarolan/palacearcade"
}

output "container_app_url" {
  value = "http://${module.web_app_container.hostname}"
}
```

Commit your code and push your changes to the remote repo. This will trigger a terraform run. You should have a new application URL in the output:

```hcl
container_app_url = http://yourprefix.azurewebsites.net
```
