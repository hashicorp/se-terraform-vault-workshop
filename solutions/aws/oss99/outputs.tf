# `terraform apply` or `terraform output` command. You can add your own text
# and include any data from the state file. Outputs are sorted alphabetically;
# use an underscore _ to move things to the bottom. In this example we're
# providing instructions to the user on how to connect to their own custom
# demo environment.
