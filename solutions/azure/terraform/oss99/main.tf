# HashiCorp Terraform and Vault Workshop
# 
# This Terraform configuration will create the following:
#
# Azure Resource group with a virtual network and subnet
# A Linux server running HashiCorp Vault and a simple application
# A hosted Azure MySQL database server

/* This is the provider block. We recommend pinning the provider version to 
a known working version. If you leave this out you'll get the latest
version. */

provider "azurerm" {
  version = "=1.30.1"
}

/* First we'll create a resource group. In Azure every resource belongs to a 
resource group. Think of it as a container to hold all your resources. 
You can find a complete list of Azure resources supported by Terraform here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/. Note the use of variables 
to dynamically set our name and location. Variables are usually defined in 
the variables.tf file, and you can override the defaults in your 
own terraform.tfvars file. */ 

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "hashitraining" {
  name     = "${var.prefix}-workshop"
  location = "${var.location}"
}

/* The next resource is a Virtual Network. We can dynamically place it into the
resource group without knowing its name ahead of time. Terraform handles all
of that for you, so everything is named consistently every time. Say goodbye
to weirdly-named mystery resources in your Azure Portal. To see how all this
works visually, run `terraform graph` and copy the output into the online
GraphViz tool: http://www.webgraphviz.com/ */

#   address_space       = ["${var.address_space}"]
#   resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.hashitraining.name}"
# }

/* Next we'll build a subnet to run our VMs in. These variables can be defined 
via environment variables, a config file, or command line flags. Default 
values will be used if the user does not override them. You can find all the
default variables in the variables.tf file. You can customize this demo by
making a copy of the terraform.tfvars.example file. */

# }

/* Now that we have a network, we'll deploy a stand-alone HashiCorp Vault 
server. Vault supports a 'dev' mode which is appropriate for demonstrations
and development purposes. In other words, don't do this in production.
An Azure Virtual Machine has several components. In this example we'll build
a security group, a network interface, a public ip address, a storage 
account and finally the VM itself. Terraform handles all the dependencies 
automatically, and each resource is named with user-defined variables. */
